Accounting Ledger is a personal project I created to keep track of my daily expenses. It has the functionality to show me each transaction I have placed, each vendor I have purchased from, each time I gained income, and the dates in which I did so. These filters can be given at the same time, or individually if expressed in the program. I also added a little terminator for fun (I mean we all love the Terminator, right?)
